## 🔄 The Concept
**Reverse LeetCode** - Instead of writing code to solve problems, you write the descriptions based on given code. This "backward thinking" approach trains developers to read, understand, and document ideas more effectively.

## 🕹️ How It Works
- AI generates clean/messy/unreadable code from a question bank
- Players interpret and explain the code's functionality  
- LLM judges responses on correctness, creativity, and clarity
- Real-time PvP battles with ELO rankings for competitiveness

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Next.js | **Backend:** Express.js + Socket.IO | **AI:** OpenAI API | **Database:** MongoDB

**Key Features:** Real-time multiplayer, custom matchmaking, AI-powered evaluation, ELO rankings

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- Full MVP with multiplayer functionality in under 24 hours
- Real-time architecture with custom lobby/matchmaking system  
- AI-integrated scoring with fine-tuned evaluation prompts
- Hackathon victory as a solo developer with zero sleep 💪
