# LeetWrite

![Hackathon Award](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackathon%202nd%20Place-🏆-blue)

## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement  
LeetWrite won **2nd place out of 800+ participants** at **ConUHacks IX**, Québec's largest hackathon.

It was built in just **24 hours** as a **solo project**! 🎉  The Devpost can be found here: https://devpost.com/software/leetwrite

## 🚀 Inspiration  
Software engineers and students often solve LeetCode problems to improve their coding skills. However, real-world software engineering also requires **understanding, documenting, and explaining** existing code.  

**LeetWrite** flips the traditional coding challenge model on its head:  
🔄 Instead of writing code, users **analyze** a given program and explain its functionality.  

This **"reverse LeetCode"** approach trains **backward thinking**, improving the ability to **read, understand, and document** code efficiently.

## 🕹️ How It Works  
- LeetWrite selects questions from a **question bank** and uses **generative AI** to create clean/messy/unreadable programs.  
- Users must **interpret the code** and write an explanation.  
- A **LLM (Large Language Model) judges** responses based on:  
  - ✅ **Correctness**  
  - 🎨 **Creativity**  
  - ✍️ **Clarity**  
- Players compete **PvP-style** and receive **ELO-based rankings** to gamify the experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Next.js  
- **Backend:** Express.js + Socket.IO  
- **AI:** OpenAI API for **code generation & evaluation**  
- **Database:** MongoDB  

### 🔥 Real-time Multiplayer Features  
- WebSockets for **live interactions**  
- Custom **game queuing & matchmaking** system  

---

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced  
- **Real-time architecture** was tricky, especially designing the **lobby system** for matchmaking.  
- Working solo meant balancing **both technical and strategic decisions** in a short timeframe.  
- Implementing **AI-based scoring** fairly required **fine-tuning prompts** and evaluation methods.  

---

## 🎯 Accomplishments  
✅ **Built a fully functional MVP** in **under 24 hours**, with **no sleep**.  
✅ **Designed and implemented** a full-fledged **multiplayer AI-powered coding challenge**.  
✅ **Won 2nd place out of 800 participants** at **ConUHacks IX**!
